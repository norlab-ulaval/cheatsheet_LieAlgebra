# Lie Algebra Cheatsheet
Inspired from 'State Estimation for Robotics' by Tim Barfoot and a lot of Lie algebra courses found online.

The aim is to regroup all the basic notions of Lie Algebra in one place, as there is a lot of notations to remember!

Also, check [Tim Barfoot's website](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/) for
* the pdf version of the book 
* a cheatsheet of all useful identities of Lie groups, algebras and jacobians.
